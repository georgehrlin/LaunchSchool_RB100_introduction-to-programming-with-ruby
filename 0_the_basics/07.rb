SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

The above error message tells me that there is a syntax error on line 2.
The error is an expected ) when an } is expected, which suggests the author
might have used a ) instead of a }.
